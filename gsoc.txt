Getting in Contact
------------------

The Myrddin hackers hang out in #myrddin on irc.eigenstate.org. We also talk
on the Myrddin mailing list, which you can join from here:
https://myrlang.org/list-subscribe.html

Here are the screen names of your potential mentors:

Ori Bernstein: Ori  
Andrew Chambers: ac  
Quentin Carbonneaux: mpu  
Roberto Vargas: k0ga  
Michanel Forney: tridactyla  

Getting Started
---------------

- Read this page. We tell you what you should do if you want to get accepted
  here.
- Introduce yourself on IRC, and ping the listed mentors for the projects you
  will be interested in. Stick around, we're usually online but not always at
  the keyboard.
- Introduce yourself on the mailing list.
- Read the [Contributing](contributing.html) page.

How to get Selected
-------------------

The most important thing you can do to get accepted is talking to us. We'll be
glad to help answer questions as you explore the projects of interest. Your
proposal should not be entirely new to the people evaluating it -- while the
bulk of the work of writing it will be done by you, we will probably have helped
flesh in details, and help make sure that you know what is involved. There's no
such thing as cheating: Putting together a proposal is a collaboration, and a
chance for us to get to know you.

In order to get in contact with the community, read the
[contributing](/contributing.html) page.

When we evaluate a proposal, we are trying to decide two things. First, we are
trying to understand whether the project will be useful to us. If the end
product doesn't solve a problem or improve the project, then we are unlikely
to accept the proposal. Second, we are looking for evidence that indicates that
you, the applicant, will successfully complete the project.

A good proposal will hit all of the following points:

- An introduction.
	- Who are you?

- A project summary
	- What is the project?
	- What benefits do you expect completing the project will bring?
	- Who have you discussed your project with? Who is mentoring you?

- A plan of action
	- How will you apporoach the project?
	- What are the critical milestones? These are the tasks without which,
	  the project will be considered a failure.
	- What are your nice-to have features? These are the tasks that you
	  will do once the critical milestones are complete.
	- What are the biggest anticipated risks?
	- How do you plan to approach these risks?

- An argument for why you specifically should be selected.
	- Why are you the right person to do the project?
	- Why do you find the project interesting?



Summer of Code Project Ideas
----------------------------

### Come with your own ideas

The most motivated applicants are the ones that scratch their own itches. If
you see something that's not on the list, bring it up, and we'll be thrilled
to discuss it and help you put together a proposal.

##### Expected Results
You tell us!

##### Knowledge Prerequisite
Yes.

#### Difficulty Level
Maybe.

#### Mentor
We'll find one.

Autogenerating C Bindings
---------------------------

Currently, binding Myrddin code to C code is a painfully manual and error
prone experience, where both Myrddin and C glue code needs to be written
by hand. This project would take implement a program to parse C headers,
and spit out both the Myrddin and the C side of the glue.

You would build on [qc](https://github.com/andrewchambers/qc), a C compiler
written in Myrddin. This compiler would be modified and extended into a
bindings generator.

For bonus points, the few places where the C and Myrddin ABIs differ
would be fixed instead of wrapped.

#### Expected Results

A program which, when pointed at an API description, will generate
Myrddin bindings for a set of C headers.

#### Suggested Knowledge

- Be familiar with Myrddin: https://myrlang.org  
- Be familiar with C: http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf  
- Understand the X64 ABI: https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/article/402129/mpx-linux64-abi.pdf  
- Understand the structure of the QC code: https://github.com/andrewchambers/qc  

#### Mentor

Andrew Chambers, Michael Forney

Porting Myrddin to Windows
---------------------------

### Porting the Myrddin Runtime to Windows
Begin a port of the Myrddin progrmaming language to Windows. The porting
process will involve compiler tweaks, assembly programming, interfacing with
the OS at a low level and contributing to the design of Myrddin standard
library.

#### Expected results

The standard mc toolchain can be compiled for windows using a cygwin based
environment.  Enough of the standard library will be functional such that the
standard build tool 'mbld' can be used. This means runtime initialization,
memory allocation and basic file io will work.

You would then proceed to tackle other aspects of the std library including
threads, sockets and anything else you have time for.

#### Suggested Knowledge

- Be familiar with Myrddin: https://myrlang.org  
- Be familiar with the Win64 ABI: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235286.aspx
- Be familiar with Windows programming

#### Difficulty Level
Medium to Hard

#### Mentor
Ori Bernstein, Andrew Chambers 

Implementing a Simple Package Manager
---------------------------

Myrddin currently has a build system, but has no package manager that
integrates nicely with it. Ideally, we would have something similar to
CPAN, Cargo, Go versioning, or similar tools for other languages. This
project will be to design and implement a simple system to index packages,
fetch them, and integrate them into the build.

#### Expected results
At the end of the summer, I will be able to run commands such as `mbld fetch`,
which will get all dependent packages needed for building a piece of code,
install them, and handle versioning and updating them.

#### Suggested Knowledge
Depends on final design. Basic HTTP, SSH, and git are likely to be necessary.

#### Difficulty Level
Easy to Medium, depending on design.

#### Mentor
Ori Bernstein, Andrew Chambers 

Implement a Math Library
------------------------

Right now, Myrddin does not ship with a math library. You would do some of
the initial work to fix this. You will pick the most important and commonly
used numeric functions, and implement them in a way that is correct, clean,
and reasonably fast.

#### Expected results

Implementations of common mathematical functions, including trigonometric
and transcendental functions.

#### Suggested Knowledge

- Numerical methods
- floating point error analysis.

#### Difficulty Level
Very hard.

#### Mentor
Ori Bernstein

Implement DWARF debug information
---------------------------

Curently, Myrddin debug information only supports line numbers, and showing
values involves printf debugging. While this is managable, it is far from
ideal. This project would implement DWARF debug information, finishing
threading type information through the backend code, emitting information to
track locations.

It's going to involve touching multiple projects, from the Myrddin compiler
to QBE, and possibly even our assemblers.

#### Expected results
`gdb obj/foo` will work. I will be able to print the values of variables, show
data structures, and generally work as expected.

#### Suggested Knowledge

- Assembly
- DWARF debugging
- GDB

#### Difficulty Level
Very hard.

#### Mentor
Ori Bernstein, Quentin Carbonneaux

Implement Thread Local Storage
---------------------------

Curently, Myrddin does not have thread local storage. This is a useful feature
to have.

This would involve learning how thread local storage is implemented across
several different platforms, hooking into those mechanisms, and adding the
ability to generate code that will reference thread local variables.

#### Expected results
It will be possible to refer to thread locals in a cross platform manner.

#### Suggested Knowledge

- Assembly
- x86-64 ABI
- Threading

#### Difficulty Level
Hard

#### Mentor
Ori Bernstein

Implement New Optimizations for QBE
----------------------------------

QBE currently has a number of optimizations that are not implemented. A
student that is interested in adding an optimization to QBE will select an
optimization, make a case for why this optimization is a good choice to
implemnt, and write code to implmeent it.

#### Expected results
QBE will have a new optimization that makes many benchmarks run faster.

#### Suggested Knowledge

- Assembly
- SSA
- Compilers

#### Difficulty Level
Variable.

#### Mentor
Ori Bernstein, Quentin Carbonneaux

Implement new ARM backend for QBE
----------------------------------

QBE currently supports x86-64 and arm-64. This project would add a new target
architecture, 32 bit arm. This would involve refactoring the middle end to
remove any target dependencies and bit size assumptions, and adding the code
to emit assembly for this new system. Of particular interest is one of the
various ARM platforms.

#### Required Knowledge

C, Compilers

#### Expected results
QBE will be able to emit code for the selected target architecture by the
end of the summer.

#### Suggested Knowledge

- Assembly
- SSA
- Compilers

#### Difficulty Level
Medium

#### Mentor
Ori Bernstein, Quentin Carbonneaux

Implement webassembly backend for QBE
----------------------------------

QBE currently supports x86-64 and arm-64. This project would add a web
target for QBE. This would involve refactoring the middle end to make sure
that target architecture dependencies are removed, and adding the code to
emit and assemble web assembly. A wasm assembler would have to be written,
since we do not believe that pulling in the giant web assembly toolchains
that currently exist is a good tradeoff.

#### Expected results
QBE will be able to emit code for the selected target architecture by the
end of the summer.

#### Suggested Knowledge

- Assembly
- SSA
- Compilers

#### Difficulty Level
Hard

#### Mentor
Ori Bernstein, Quentin Carbonneaux

Add output formats to cross-linker
----------------------------------

Both Myrddin and SCC are in the process of migrating to our own toolchain,
and removing the overly complex binutils, and instead moving to a linker and
assmebler designed for cross compilation.

As part of the work to do this, we've started to implement a cross-linker,
which can take object files in the Myro format, and turn it into a binary
for any of our supported target architectures.

If you take on this project, you will be adding more supported target
architectures, such as Mach-O or ELF. Dynamic linking to existing shared
objects should be supported.

#### Expected Results

Being able to link for any supported platform from any supported platform.

#### Suggested Knowledge

- Various binary formats:
  - ELF, a.out, mach-o, ...
- Assembly

#### Difficulty Level
Medium

#### Mentor
Roberto Vargas, Ori Bernstein


Add a new platform to the SCC Assemblers
---------------------------------------

As mentioned above, both Myrddin and SCC are in the process of migrating to our
own toolchain. We've got an assembler for several platforms, but we will need
a few more added in. Arm64, Arm32, MIPS, and many others are desired.

#### Expected Results:

We will be able to assemble code for the platform of your choice.

#### Required Knowledge

- Assembly 
- C
- Linking process

#### Difficulty Level
Medium

#### Mentor
Roberto Vargas, Ori Bernstein


Implement a DFA cache for libregex
----------------------------------

The Myrddin regex library is currently fast enough for many purposes, but
not as fast as it could be. One major source of improvement could be the
addition of a DFA cache. This would be built as the regex executed, and
would improve the performance of regex execution.

#### Expected results
Faster regexes.

#### Difficulty Level
Medium to hard.

#### Required knowledge

- DFAs
- Regex

#### Mentor
Ori Bernstein, Quentin Carbonneaux

Implement a Documentation Generator
----------------------------------

Currently, library documentation is maintained by hand. It would be nice
to have some tools in Myrddin to generate documentation automatically,
stitching together code, external documents, and cross referencing things
appropriately.

This could be done by either adapting an existing documentation generator,
or writing one from scratch.

Ideally, this generator would be able to output both manpages and
HTML.

#### Expected Results

The ability to automatically create documentation from source code
and side-text. It should check and warn (or error) if the documentation
is incomplete.

#### Required Knowledge

- HTML
- Troff
- Parsers

#### Mentor

Ori Bernstein

Improve Cross Compilation
---------------------------

Currently, it's fairly painful to cross compile Myrddin. There's no
reason for this, since we can know how to invoke the appropriate toolchains,
and have no external dependencies that are difficult to set up. At this
point, the bulk of the work is teaching mbld to invoke the appropriate
non-native toolchains.


#### Expected Results

We should be able to painlessly build for any system from any other system,
without trouble, assuming an appropriate toolchain is available.

#### Required Knowledge

- Compilers
- Assembly
- Unix.
