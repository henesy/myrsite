}

This is the page where the Myrddin language is documented. You want to know
all the boring, dull details? Well, they're here.

APIs
----

### [Libstd](libstd/index.html)

The standard library. You'll probably be using it in all your code, because
it's the standard. It's intended to cover a good portion of the functionality
that you'll need for any program. It's a bit of a grab bag, but can be roughly
categorized into the following subsections:

- [Memory Allocation](libstd/alloc.html): All of your memory allocation needs.
- [Error Handling](libstd/err.html): Convenient utilities for aborting your program.
- [OS Interfaces](libstd/os.html): Ask not what you can do for your OS, ask what
  your OS can do for you.
- [File Handling](libstd/files.html): Sometimes data just wants to persist.
- [Networking](libstd/networking.html): Communicating with other systems isn't just
  a fad.
- [Command Line Parsing](libstd/cli.html): Makes it easy to parse options from the
  command line.
- [Formatted Output](libstd/fmt.html): I/O. Without monads.
- [Variadic Arguments](libstd/varargs.html): If you want ugly APIs, we've got you
  covered.
- [Slice manipulation](libstd/slices.html): Some generic functions. Easy to write
  yourself, but a bit tedious.
- [String Manipulation](libstd/strings.html): Some Unicode-aware string poking.
- [Unicode](libstd/unicode.html): Wait a second, all languages aren't English?
- [Pervasive Data Structures](libstd/datastruct.html): At least, I use them a lot.
- [Big Integers](libstd/bigint.html): Big integers. They're useful for some things.
  If you use them too, we've got you covered.
- [Misc](libstd/misc.html): Random crap that doesn't really fit into a category.

### [Libsys](libsys/index.html)

Libsys is a direct interface to system calls provided by the platform. It is 
a platform specific wrapper to the system. The documentation for the various
system calls is largely deferred to the systems themselves.

Any code that uses libsys will likely not be portable, but in many cases it
is the only way to access system specific functionality, which may not be
implemented elsewhere.


### [Libbio](libbio/index.html)

This is a buffered IO library. It allows for many small reads and writes to be
done with better performance than writing a system call for each one. On top
of that, it allows for more convenient interfaces to handle linewise or
delimited input, where peeking at the input stream may be necessary.

### [Libregex](libregex/index.html)

This is a regex library, as implied by the name. It implements a simple but
powerful regex syntax, with full Unicode support. It also exposes the regex
syntax tree if needed, which is useful for code that wants custom regex
handling, but wants to remain consistent with the myrddin regex syntax.

### [Libcrypto](libcrypto/index.html)

This is a library that handles cryptographic functions. It aims to implement
the most common cryptographic hashes and ciphers, and provides a fairly
consistent interface to it.

### [Libdate](libdate/index.html)

Libdate provides a fairly complete interface for manipulating dates, times,
and timezones. It handles adding durations and periods to dates, formatting
and parsing dates.

### [Libthread](libthread/index.html)

Libthread is currently half-assed and broken, and it doesn't work very well
with libstd, which is not yet thread aware. This needs work.

Utilities
---------

### [Mbld](../mbld)

Mbld is the Myrddin build tool. It knows how to handle source and library
dependencies, as well as build generated sources.
