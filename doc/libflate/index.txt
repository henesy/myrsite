Summary
-------
	
    pkg flate =
        const decode : (outf : bio.file#, inf : bio.file# -> std.result(void, err))
    ;;

Libflate decodes one bio file into another bio file. The decode function
guarantees that it will not read more than necessary from inf to either,
figure out that the stream is bogus, or fully uncompress the stream.
