Contact Info
------------

The Myrddin hackers hang out in #myrddin on irc.eigenstate.org. Most
design discussion happens there.  You can join using your favorite client, or
online via [kiwi IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.eigenstate.org/?nick=yournick#myrddin)

We also have the [myrddin-dev](http://eigenstate.org/mail-lists.html)
mailing list on eigenstate.org, which is largely used for announcements
and design summaries.

Submitting Code
---------------

The canonical code repository is on
[https://git.eigenstate.org](https://git.eigenstate.org), but is
mirrored on GitHub. We prefer if you email patches on the mailing list,
but alternatives are fine. We'll take GitHub pull requests, links to
a repository with changes, or or snail mail (Please inquire in IRC for the
address).

Proposing Libraries for Inclusion
---------------------------------

If you've written a library for Myrddin, and you feel like it can be merged
with the current standard library, or it is generally useful enough to be
shipped, linked or otherwise made public, feel free to contact us.

Overall, Myrddin's plan is to ship with a wide variety of "batteries included"
libraries, and we'd love to have your code be a part of that.

Updating the site
----------------

This [website](http://git.eigenstate.org/ori/myrsite.git) is maintained using
markdown, and is stored in git. We accept pull requests for it, and treat it
like a wiki.

	git clone git://git.eigenstate.org/ori/myrsite.git

Should you wish to generate the HTML locally, the site is generated using
[USSM](http://loup-vaillant.fr/projects/ussm/), and compiled with a mildly
customized Markdown compiler, which knows how to generate runnable code
snippets. This markdown compiler is available
[here](https://git.eigenstate.org/ori/sundown-myr.git).
