Myrcon
-------

Since there are a number of people interested in Myrddin planning on
showing up at EuroBSD, there's an informal meetup happening. If you're
showing up to a useful conference, why not balance it out with a useless
one?

Breaking Changes
----------------

- std.Ordonly and std.Owronly have been named to std.Oread and std.Owrite.
- `for x in y` became `for x : y`. It's only a warning right now, but it will
  break your code soon.

- Solsock is now called Solsocket, and it's type changed to match getsockopt.
- Output no longer clutters the source directory, but instead goes into
  `obj/`.
- `mbld test` no longer impliciltly adds files to the test build.
- Custom hash functions return int64, not int32.
- Several unnecessary options (`-d`, `-l`, `-C`, `-M`) were removed from mbld.
