Myrddin 0.1.1: "Shame. Shame. Shame."
-------------------------------------

Myrddin 0.1.1 has been released. It is nearly identical, but compiles
problem-free on all tested systems.

Myrddin 0.1: "The Sobbing Never Ends"
-------------------------------------

Myrddin 0.1 has been released. It's full of sharp edges and bugs. It's
targeted towards people with a larger than average amount of self loathing.
All parts of the language and libraries are subject to change, breakage, and
unbreakage.

The 0.1 release comes with an amd64 compiler. The supported platforms are
Linux, OSX, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Plan9front.

To get started, check out the [tutorial](../tutorial). The [language
spec](../spec) has also been revised and updated. It now has fewer lies.

Additionally, our [library documentation](../doc/) has been fixed and updated,
and should reflect the state of our libraries.

### Changes since the last version

Yes.

### Tarballs

The release tarballs are on
[https://myrlang.org/releases](https://myrlang.org/releases/). The
tag for the release is `r0.2.0`.


### Packages and Installation

Myrddin 0.1 has been packaged for supported systems. It is also easy to
install from source.

#### From Git

Myrddin is a young language. There are regular fixes to the language and
libraries. Therefore, it's probably a good idea to install it from Git. To
install Myrddin from source:

	git clone git://git.eigenstate.org/git/ori/mc.git
	cd mc
	./configure --prefix=/usr
	make	# gmake on BSD systems
	sudo make install

#### Debian and Ubuntu

Myrddin has been put into a `deb` package. Here is how you can install
it on any Debian based distro:

	wget https://myrlang.org/pkg/myrddin_0.1.0_amd64.deb
	dpkg -i myrddin_0.1.0_amd64.deb

#### Mac OSX

There is a brew tap for OSX. If you have Homebrew installed,
here is how you can use it to install Myrddin:

	brew install oridb/myrddin/myrddin

#### FreeBSD

There is an external makefile for the ports tree. Here is how you
can use it to install Myrddin via the FreeBSD package system:

	git clone git://git.eigenstate.org/git/ori/freebsd-myrddin
	cd freebsd-myrddin/myrddin
	make install

#### OpenBSD

The port for Myrddin is in the OpenBSD ports tree. You can install it
using:

	pkg_add myrddin

#### Plan 9

Because Mercurial is the preferred distribution mechanism for Plan 9, there
is a mirror of the repository on Bitbucket. To install it:

	hg clone https://bitbucket.org/oridb/mc
	cd mc
	mk
	mk install

This release has been tested on 9front. In theory it should work on
any amd64 version of Plan 9 out of the box.

### Future Releases

Myrddin is aiming to have releases every 6 months. Whatever features
are ready by then will be shipped.

For 0.2, one major goal is to have a [QBE](https://c9x.me/compile/)
backend. This will significantly improve the performance of our generated
code, and make it easier to interface with C.

Libraries will continue to be an ongoing theme. Having libraries is often
the difference between feasibly using a language for a project, or picking
something with fewer wheels to reinvent.
