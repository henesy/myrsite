GARGLE SUMMER OF COD
--------------------

As you may have noticed, we were not accepted for this year's google summer of
code, in spite of our organization vitality and clear leadership in the 'wheel
reinvention' domain. However, we've got a backup plan.

Today I'm pleased to announce that I am announcing the GARGLE SUMMER OF COD.
This program is smaller than 'Summer of Code'. Precisely one letter
smaller, in fact.

Eligibility:
============

In order to qualify for GARGLE SUMMER OF COD, we will need to be able
to ship you cod. If we can figure out how to ship your sea-stipend, you are
elegible to apply. Talk to us for shipping details.

If you've got a completed project, we'll be shipping the fish out on
August 31st. Let us know in advance, so we can 

Stipend:
========

Of course, good work should be rewarded. And, since we all know that
sea lions love fish, we'll be rewarding you in cod.

A successful project will be rewarded several pounds of cod. Vegetarian
substitutes are available. (Are sea cucumbers vegetables?)

Project ideas:
==============

We have the Google Summer of Code page up. Use it for ideas.

How To Apply
============

Send an email to the [mailing list](https://myrlang.org/list-subscribe),
or ping us on IRC. If your idea sounds interesting, and you seem like
yu will be able to execute, we'll put your name down as a participant.

Because there's only so much fish I'm willing to have shipped, there is a
limited number of slots, so let us know you're planning to work on something
in advance.

At the end of the summer, if you've produced code, we ship cod.
